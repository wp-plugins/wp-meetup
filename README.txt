WP Meetup fetches event information from Meetup.com and creates posts for each event.

== Description ==

WP Meetup fetches event information from Meetup.com and creates posts for each event.  Additionally, WP Meetup provides an event calendar for displaying upcoming events either on a page or as a widget.

Uses the [Meetup PHP API](https://github.com/wizonesolutions/meetup_api) developed by wizonesolutions.

For more detailed information visit the plugin homepage at [Nuanced Media](http://nuancedmedia.com/wordpress-meetup-plugin/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-meetup.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the options page located at Settings -> WP Meetup and follow the instructions.
4. To include the event calendar on a page, create a new page and in the content editor, enter `[wp-meetup-calendar]` where you want the calendar to appear on the page.
5. To include a variable number of months on the event calender, use shortcode, e.g. `[wp-meetup-calendar number_of_months='4']` by default the calender displays two months (the current, and the next).
6. Starting with version 1.5.0, you now have the ability to show any number of previous and future events! Try, for example, [wp-meetup-calendar start_month=-2 end_month=2]. This will show a total of 4 months (2 previous months, and the next 2 months, all relative to the current month). Play around with it, it's great to be able to have this variable calendar showing!

**Important: If you're upgrading from a version prior to 1.2, make sure to disable the plugin and re-enable it.**
